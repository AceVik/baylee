/// opponent." Two things are being asserted, and the card was broken on
/// both until `TargetSpec::AnyOpponent` existed. A trigger may point at a
/// *player* at all — before this, `eval::target_options` returned an empty
/// list for a player spec and CR 603.3d quietly binned the trigger — and
/// "target opponent" is a choice over the opponents only (CR 115.1), so the
