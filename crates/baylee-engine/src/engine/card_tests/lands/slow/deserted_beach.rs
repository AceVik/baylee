/// Deserted Beach, a slow land: "This land enters tapped unless you control
/// two or more **other** lands."
///
/// The word doing the work is "other", and the answer to it is that a
/// permanent's own enters-clause is a replacement applied on the way in, so
/// the land never counts itself. Both halves are one test because the board
/// that proves it is the same board one turn apart: the first Beach arrives
/// with an Island beside it and is the second land on the table, which is
/// two lands and still only *one* other; the second arrives with the Island
/// and the first Beach and comes in untapped. A tapped land counts — the
/// sentence asks what you control, not what is ready.
///
/// The three Forests across the table are the bystander, and they are
/// standing there for the first half, where counting them would have said
/// untapped.
