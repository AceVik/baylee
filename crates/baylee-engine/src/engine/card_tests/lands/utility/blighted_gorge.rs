/// Blighted Gorge: "{4}{R}, {T}, Sacrifice this land: it deals 2 damage to
/// any target" — at a table with no creature on it.
///
/// "Any target" is one set spanning objects and players (CR 115.4), and the
/// offer used to count only the objects: with an empty board the ability was
/// withheld, although a player is always there to point at. The activation
/// then had the second half of the same fault, so the two ends of this test
/// are two defects — the ability has to be offered, and it has to go
/// through.
