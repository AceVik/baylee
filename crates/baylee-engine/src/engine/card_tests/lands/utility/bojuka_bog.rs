/// Bojuka Bog: "When this land enters, exile **target player's** graveyard."
///
/// `PlayerRel::Chosen` — the seat the trigger pointed at — is the other half
/// of the relation `eval::players` cannot answer, and it fails the same
/// silent way: the loop ran over an empty list, the trigger resolved, and the
/// land was a Swamp that cost a land drop.
///
/// Both graveyards are seeded and only one is named, because a fix that
/// resolved `Chosen` as "each player" would empty the caster's own graveyard
/// too and would otherwise pass unnoticed.
