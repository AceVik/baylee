# Performance Baseline

Hardware: MacBook M1 Max, 64 GB. Measured with `cargo bench -p baylee-engine`
(criterion, debug assertions off for benches). CI runs the benches
(`--quick`) so they never rot; comparing numbers against this table is a
**manual** step — shared-runner timing is too noisy for a hard regression
gate. (An earlier version of this paragraph claimed automated 10 %
budgets; that job never existed.)

## M1.S4 (2026-08, Rust 1.98)

| Path | Baseline | Blueprint budget | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup/from_preset` (2×60-card decks, shuffles, opening hands) | 13.8 µs | — | — |
| `state/clone` (full game state, AI lookahead primitive) | 8.6 µs | < 5 µs | ⚠️ optimize in M2 (arena layout) |
| `state/snapshot_hash` | 5.3 µs | — | — |
| `engine/priority_pass_x4` (4× priority pass incl. legality computation) | 3.7 µs | < 50 µs per `legal_actions` | ✅ far under |

Notes:
- Clone is currently dominated by `Vec` allocations in zones/arena; the M2
  plan is copy-on-write zone storage or arena slabs with shared tails.
- Legality is recomputed per priority grant; M2 adds invalidation-scoped
  caches keyed on the effect/event generation.

## Layer projection rewrite (2026-08-31)

Both columns were measured on the same machine in the same session: "before"
is commit `67b1815` with the *current* bench file copied in, so the two runs
measure the same work.

| Path | Before | After | Change |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setup/from_preset` | 13.65 µs | 13.06 µs | −4 % |
| `state/clone` | 8.88 µs | 7.80 µs | −12 % |
| `state/snapshot_hash` | 5.28 µs | 6.25 µs | **+18 %** |
| `engine/priority_pass_x4` | 3.03 µs | 2.78 µs | −8 % |
| `layers/refresh_x1` | 4.05 µs | 4.68 µs | +15 % |
| `layers/refresh_x8` | 15.66 µs | 6.18 µs | **2.5× faster** |
| `layers/refresh_x32` | 116.6 µs | 13.67 µs | **8.5× faster** |

`layers/refresh_xN` is a new bench: a ~60-permanent battlefield under N
anthems, forced to recompute. It exists because nothing else in the file
grows with the number of continuous effects, so the change this table is
about was invisible before.

What the numbers say:

- **Scaling is the point.** Going from 1 to 32 effects cost 28.8× before and
  costs 2.9× now. The old projection sorted every effect from scratch for
  every object it touched (`objects · layers · effects²`); the plan is now
  built once per refresh and each object walks only the effects that can
  reach it (`layers · effects² + objects · effects`). A board under a handful
  of anthems is where real games live, and that is the 2.5× column.
- **The fixed cost went up slightly.** At a single effect the plan build is
  pure overhead (+15 %). That is the trade, and it is the right way round.
- **Clone got 12 % cheaper** because `GameObject` went 768 → 512 B (the
  projection cache became a lazy 24-byte slot). `tests/footprint.rs` keeps it
  there. Since raised to **528 B**: a token now carries the `TokenDef` it was
  made from, which is what gives it its printed abilities (a Treasure that
  can actually be cracked) and the handle the client keys its art on. One
  pointer, ~3 % of the object, taken deliberately against the 33 % the
  cache rewrite bought.
- **`snapshot_hash` regressed 18 % and the cause is the object layout, not
  the added `deathtouched` field** — removing that field from the hash
  entirely measures the same 6.3 µs. It is not on a budgeted path (resync and
  loop-free replay comparison), so it is recorded rather than chased.
